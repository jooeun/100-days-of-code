# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Legend

### Day CX : regular day of code
### Day TX: Some form of training (algorithm practice, tutorials, etc.)

## I'm not following the original version, just read https://github.com/shuroukami/100-days-of-code/blob/master/rules.md before you yell at me.

### Day 0: August 20, 2018
##### *(Prior to starting all this)*

**Starting point**: Did a couple of leetcode exercises, started dabbling with jest and babel by using the addition/subtraction fact "project" as an excuse. Moved some github repos to bitbucket because... Because, I guess.

**Thoughts:** Heeeerrree we go.

### Day 1 (T1): August 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Tried to solve https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/description/. I did both brute force and extra array (did that first) solutions without help. I had the big idea correct for what was listed as solution 3, but I was not able to come up with a final solution.

**Thoughts**: Reading the solution, I don't actually understand why the author states that Solution 3 is an O(n), one-pass solution when there is a do-while loop (which, admittedly, wouldn't iterate through the entire array)? Oh well, maybe I'll go back to this again later. Spent waaaay too much time fishing for a way to do without the inner do-while loop (which prevented me from arriving at it in the first place)...

### Day 2 (C1): August 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Progress? I'm not sure if I should even really count this, but just worked on an internal tool for my personal use. Tried messing with using .NET Core, .NET Framwork, and .NET Standard all in the same solution, seems like the tooling in VS is a bit wonky, so I'll try that again some other time.

...and now that I'm done going down that rabbit hole that is my tool, I learned some more about regex and messing with ID3 tags in .NET. This was more educational than I thought it would be!

**Thoughts**: Hilarious that this has nothing to do with any real learning that I wanted to do, yet this is the one thing that actually follows the #100DaysOfCode definition the closest.

### Day 3 (C2): August 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished that personal tool of mine. Did a bit of refactoring/clean-up so that I don't let it drop off my mind completely like last time.

### Day 4 (T2): September 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Eased into algorithm practice again on leetcode, will dive into the interview question pile after I'm a bit more comfortable with more concepts presented there.

**Thoughts**: Really wanna get back on that react tutorial, too...

### Day 5 (T3): September 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started 2-D array portion in leetcode. Stopping midway without finishing diagnoal traverse question, too late in the night.

**Thoughts**: At least it's a "medium" question...
