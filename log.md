# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Legend

### Day CX : regular day of code
### Day TX: Some form of training (algorithm practice, tutorials, etc.)

## I'm not following the original version, just read https://github.com/shuroukami/100-days-of-code/blob/master/rules.md before you yell at me.

### Day 0: August 20, 2018
##### *(Prior to starting all this)*

**Starting point**: Did a couple of leetcode exercises, started dabbling with jest and babel by using the addition/subtraction fact "project" as an excuse. Moved some github repos to bitbucket because... Because, I guess.

**Thoughts:** Heeeerrree we go.

### Day 1 (T1): August 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Tried to solve https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/description/. I did both brute force and extra array (did that first) solutions without help. I had the big idea correct for what was listed as solution 3, but I was not able to come up with a final solution.

**Thoughts**: Reading the solution, I don't actually understand why the author states that Solution 3 is an O(n), one-pass solution when there is a do-while loop (which, admittedly, wouldn't iterate through the entire array)? Oh well, maybe I'll go back to this again later. Spent waaaay too much time fishing for a way to do without the inner do-while loop (which prevented me from arriving at it in the first place)...
